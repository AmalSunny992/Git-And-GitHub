# Feature Development Workflow

This workflow guides you through the steps of developing a new feature in a Git repository.

## Steps

1. **Start from the Main Branch**
   - Ensure you're on the `main` branch and it's up to date:
     ```sh
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     ```

2. **Create a New Feature Branch**
   - Create a new branch for your feature:
     ```sh
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```

3. **Develop Your Feature**
   - Make changes and commit them to your feature branch:
     ```sh
     # Make changes to your files
     git add .
     git commit -m "Describe your changes"
     ```

4. **Rebase with Main Branch**
   - Periodically rebase your branch with `main` to keep it up to date:
     ```sh
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     git checkout feature/your-feature-name
     git rebase main
     ```

5. **Resolve Conflicts (if any)**
   - If there are conflicts during rebase, resolve them and continue:
     ```sh
     # Resolve conflicts in your editor
     git add <resolved-files>
     git rebase --continue
     ```

6. **Push Your Feature Branch**
   - Push your feature branch to the remote repository:
     ```sh
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**
   - On GitHub, create a pull request from `feature/your-feature-name` to `main`.
   - Request reviews and make any necessary changes based on feedback.

8. **Merge the Pull Request**
   - Once approved, merge the pull request into `main`.

9. **Delete the Feature Branch**
   - After merging, delete the feature branch both locally and remotely:
     ```sh
     git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
     git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
     ```

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the feature development workflow.
