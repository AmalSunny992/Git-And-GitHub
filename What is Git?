# What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 
It is free and open-source software originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

## Key Features of Git

- **Distributed System**: Every developer has a complete copy of the entire repository, including the full history of changes.
- **Speed**: Git is fast. Performing actions such as commits, diffs, and merges can be done quickly.
- **Scalability**: Git can handle projects of any size, from a few files to large codebases with millions of lines of code.
- **Branching and Merging**: Git makes branching and merging straightforward and helps in parallel development workflows.
- **Data Integrity**: Git ensures the integrity of your data using a combination of SHA-1 hashes to track changes.

## Why Use Git?

- **Version Control**: Keep track of every change to your codebase, who made the change, and when it was made.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other.
- **Backup**: Every clone of the repository is a full backup, reducing the risk of data loss.
- **Reversibility**: Easily revert to previous states of the codebase if something goes wrong.

## Basic Concepts

- **Repository**: A Git repository is a storage space where your project lives. It tracks and saves the complete history of your changes.
- **Commit**: A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID.
- **Branch**: A branch is a separate line of development. You can create branches to work on new features without affecting the main codebase.
- **Merge**: Merging is the process of combining the changes from different branches into one.
